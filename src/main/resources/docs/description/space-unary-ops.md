Some styleguides require or disallow spaces before or after unary operators. This is mainly a stylistic issue, however, some JavaScript expressions can be written without spacing which makes it harder to read and maintain.
Fixable: This rule is automatically fixable using the --fix flag on the command line.
This rule enforces consistency regarding the spaces after words unary operators and after/before nonwords unary operators.
