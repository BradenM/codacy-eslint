Multiple spaces in a row that are not used for indentation are typically mistakes. This rule aims to disallow multiple whitespace around logical expressions, conditional expressions, declarations, array elements, object properties, sequences and function parameters.

```
//Bad:
if(foo  === "bar") {}

//Good:
if(foo === "bar") {}


```
