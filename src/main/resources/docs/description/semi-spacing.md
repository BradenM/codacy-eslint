JavaScript allows you to place unnecessary spaces before or after a semicolon.
Disallowing or enforcing space around a semicolon can improve the readability of your program.
This rule aims to enforce spacing around a semicolon. This rule prevents the use of spaces before a semicolon in expressions.

```
//Bad:
var a = "b" ;
var c = "d";//Space here

//Good:
var e = "f";

```
