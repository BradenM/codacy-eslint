JavaScript allows you to place newlines before or after a dot in a member expression.
Consistency in placing a newline before or after the dot can greatly increase readability.
This rule aims to enforce newline consistency in member expressions. This rule prevents the use of mixed newlines around the dot in a member expression.

```
var a = universe. galaxy;
var b = universe .galaxy;

```
