Yoda conditions are so named because the literal value of the condition comes first while the variable comes second. For example, the following is a Yoda condition:
This is called a Yoda condition because it reads as, "red is the color", similar to the way the Star Wars character Yoda speaks. Compare to the other way of arranging the operands:
This typically reads, "color is red", which is arguably a more natural way to describe the comparison.

```
if ("red" === color) {
// ... }

```
