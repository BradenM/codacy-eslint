Yoda conditions are so named because the literal value of the condition comes first while the variable comes second. For example, the following is a Yoda condition: This is called a Yoda condition because it reads as, "red is the color", similar to the way the Star Wars character Yoda speaks. Compare to the other way of arranging the operands.

```
//Bad:
if ("red" === color) {
    // ...
}

if (true == flag) {
    // ...
}

```
