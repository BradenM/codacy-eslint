Disallowing usage of specific node modules can be useful if you want to control the available methods, a developer can use, to implement a feature.
This way you can block usage of the fs module if you want disallow file system access. Blocking the os module can be useful if you don't want to allow any operating system specific code.
This rule allows you to specify modules that you don't want to use in your application.
